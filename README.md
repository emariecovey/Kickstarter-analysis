# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
---
## Campaign description
###Louise is fundraising for a play and wanted to find out the most effective ways of fundraising based on data from other kickstarter campaigns. She wanted to see when campaigns were most successful, how many campaigns were successful, average goal of successful campaigns, etc. to determine how and when she should start her campaign.

## Recommendations for Louise: 
1. Many theater campaigns were funded (just over half), so there is hope that hers can as well. See Parent Category Outcomes Chart. 
2. Start the campaign in May. See Launchdate image.
3. Ask for far less than her $4000 original goal (preferably closer to $2000). See Goal and Pledged image
